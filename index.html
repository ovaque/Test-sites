    <p> Erasmus Global is an English language institute. The institute is situated in Jalandhar city of Punjab, India. The director
      of the institute, Mr Harry Bhugtaana, has studied abroad and is a published writer. He is certified by the University
      of Cambridge in England to teach English to speakers of other languages (ESOL). Prior to opening the institute Mr Harry
      Bhugtaana taught English at a Japanese institute to Japanese people. He has been active as an English language teacher
      since 2012 and has gained valuable experience learning and teaching English to people of different nationalities. Erasmus
      Global is the sum total of his experiences thus far as well as a personal and professional exploration of learning
      in the future. The primary objective in establishing Erasmus Global is to impart English language skills in a holistic
      manner, where the learner adopts a vital and active role. This participation allows for a quick acquisition of language
      by promoting confidence and developing personality of the learner. We are determined to follow and invent approaches
      that are modern and student-orientated leading to student autonomy. We believe in fostering skills in a thoroughly
      practical manner which enables one to excel in life while simultaneously opening avenues for personal enrichment.
      <br> Our vision is broad and long-term. We endeavour to implement a global platform of learning and education. More importantly
      we look forward to working with people such as you to help you grow in your path and build our network of relationships.
